
% Finding the ZMP points to achieve a desired fixed point by using optimization with the Essential model
% ==============================
% Creation: 25/may/2021
% Last modification: --/--/----
% -----------------------------------------------------------------------
% Finding the ZMP points to take the robot from the dynamic walking on the fixed point to a rest position (supported on its both feet).
% -----------------------------------------------------------------------
% The walking gait start at the fixed point in single support, then a small step is performed to let both feet aligned and finish in DS.
% This code is based on "M71a_StartingPhase_Optimization_DS_SS_DS_reduced" but in here the optimized parameters are:
% 1-> ZMP in X  for final SS and initial DS
% 2-> ZMP in Y  for final SS and initial DS
% 3-> ZMP in X  for intermediate and final DS
% 4-> ZMP in Y  for intermediate DS 
%
% Note: The evolution of the ZMP for the 2 phases are straight lines. In fact:
%       Initial ZMP in X and Y for SS is fixed
%       Final ZMP in Y for DS is fixed

% Finding the ZMP points to take the robot from the dynamic walking on the fixed point to a rest position (supported on its both feet).
% -----------------------------------------------------------------------
% The walking gait start at the fixed point in single support, then a small step is performed to let both feet aligned and finish in DS.
% This code is based on "M71a_StartingPhase_Optimization_DS_SS_DS_reduced" but in here the optimized parameters are:
% 1-> ZMP in X  for final SS and initial DS
% 2-> ZMP in Y  for final SS and initial DS
% 3-> ZMP in X  for intermediate and final DS
% 4-> ZMP in Y  for intermediate DS 
%
% Note: The evolution of the ZMP for the 2 phases are straight lines. In fact:
%       Initial ZMP in X and Y for SS is fixed
%       Final ZMP in Y for DS is fixed

% Finding the ZMP points to achieve a desired fixed point by using optimization with the Essential model
% ==============================
% Creation: 25/may/2021
% Last modification: --/--/----
% -----------------------------------------------------------------------
% Finding the ZMP points to take the robot from the dynamic walking on the fixed point to a rest position (supported on its both feet).
% -----------------------------------------------------------------------
% The walking gait start at the fixed point in single support, then a small step is performed to let both feet aligned and finish in DS.
% This code is based on "M71a_StartingPhase_Optimization_DS_SS_DS_reduced" but in here the optimized parameters are:
% 1-> ZMP in X  for final SS and initial DS
% 2-> ZMP in Y  for final SS and initial DS
% 3-> ZMP in X  for intermediate and final DS
% 4-> ZMP in Y  for intermediate DS 
%
% Note: The evolution of the ZMP for the 2 phases are straight lines. In fact:
%       Initial ZMP in X and Y for SS is fixed
%       Final ZMP in Y for DS is fixed
